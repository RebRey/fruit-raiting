# fruit-rating
Make a database of fruits with ratings of the ones you have tried.

## Set-Up:

On the Command Line Interface (CLI) cd into your project and do the following:

1) Initialize npm. Follow the prompts on the CLI. This will create a package.json file.
```
npm init
```

2) Install the native MongoDB Driver using npm. See documentation here: [Click Me](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/quick-start/) 
```
npm install mongodb@5.0
```

When you install the Node.js Driver this will do the following:
* Downloads the mongodb package and the dependencies it requires
* Saves the package in the node_modules directory
* Records the dependency information in the package.json file
